My try at making Game Of Life, with standart rules. But I added that, if cell gets stuck at being alive for every iteration of it more red color will be added to it, once it reaches 255, it will explode killing all living neighbours around it 2 cells wide, and will randomly make some cells alive 2 cells wide around it.

Game can be paused/resumed at any time.
If reset button is clicked, old cells will be killed and new ones will be made instead. Game will start with 0 living cells again. Reset can only work if game is paused.

Amount of rows/columns can be confirmed only if game is paused. Maximum rows/columns is 150. But anything over 100 can take a while to load.

Amount of living cells can be confirmed only when paused. Maximum is always less then total amount of cells.

Frames per second can be changed while game runs, minimum is 1, maximum is 60.

Cells can be clicked, changing its state, alive/dead, so patterns can be created when paused and then game ran to see what patterns will emerge.

Button icons are from Font Awesome.
